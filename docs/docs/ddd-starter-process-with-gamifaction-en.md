# Starting with Domain-Driven Design

## Domain-Driven Design Starter Modeling Process of the DDD-Crew

The [DDD-Crew]() describes their [Domain-Driven Design Starter Modeling Process]() as a 

>step-by-step guide for learning and practically applying each aspect of Domain-Driven Design 
>(DDD) - from orienting around an organisation's business model to coding a domain model.

The process includes all aspects for designing the software architecture of a complex business domain 
with the DDD mindset!

The process is not a linear sequence of steps that should be followed. 
Domain-Driven Design is an evolutionary design process which necessitates continuous iteration 
on all aspects of knowledge and design.

The process supports with valuable knowledge and methods for performing the steps of the process.
For each step the process describes who is to envolve and which (collaborative) methods and tools
are beneficial to use.

Especially when domain-driven design will be introduced, it is necessary 
to learn and build up knowledge. The business domain needs an Architecture (Modernization) Enabling to
establish domain-driven design successfully. It does not matter if you have a greenfield project or a brownfield project.
Only that the brownfield is harder and additional aspects must be considered.

Domain-Driven Design Cards is a gamification approach, applicable in different steps 
of the domain-driven design starter modeling process to support collaboration, performing the steps 
and learning on the job.

[Read here more](./mkdocs-en.md) about the idea of enabling by gamification.

The following visualization show the starter process and the steps, supported with the game of Domain-Driven Design Cards.
