## Enable Domain-Driven Design with Gamification

Domain-Driven Design Cards offer valuable methodological support for a range of strategic and
tactical Domain-Driven Design workshops, and they're available for free. This initiative is a collaborative
project with [nilsbert](https://github.com/nilsbert). For more information about us, you can explore the [website](www.architecture-enablers.de).

With Domain-Driven Design Cards, you can engage in activities such as the Context Mapping Game,
the Strategic Classification Game, the Bounded Context Game, and the Architecture Game. If you're looking for a comprehensive guide
on how to use them, please consult the following sections.

## Bounded Context Game

Identify domain-related boundaries (subdomains, bounded contexts) within your business domain.

## Context Mapping Game

Define dependencies between bounded contexts.

## Strategic Classification Game

Determine the strategic importance of your subdomains and bounded contexts.

## Tactical Architecture Game

Define the tactical architectural construction plan collaboratively within the development team.

## Enabling and Enabler Teams

_Team Topologies_ describes Enabler Teams with the task of helping other teams effectively and efficiently shape their development process. Stream-Aligned Teams focus on continuous progress in software development (Fast Flow). Enabler Teams aim to prevent focus loss in Stream-Aligned Teams and provide support on specific topics. Possible examples include:
* Application Performance Monitoring
* Test-Driven Development
* Continuous Delivery
* Behavior-Driven Development
* Application Security
* Software Architecture
* Domain-Driven Design
* Architecture Modernization and Refactoring

The goal of this collaboration is to enable Stream-Aligned Teams to complete their work in the desired timeframe and sustainably maintain the required quality.

Enabler Teams work with Stream-Aligned Teams for a temporary period, typically spanning weeks to a few months. The goal of the Enabler Team is to transfer knowledge and empower the teams so that Stream-Aligned Teams can continue the tasks independently in the future, ideally without losing focus on the continuous generation of a value stream.

## Gamification

The core idea of gamification is to integrate principles and elements from games into non-game contexts to increase motivation, creativity, engagement, and interaction among people. A key success factor is intrinsic motivation and the natural play instinct of people to exhibit desired behaviors, complete tasks, or achieve goals.

With a focus on Domain-Driven Design Cards, players as a team face challenges that they must overcome together. This occurs in the form of missions that need to be completed during the course of the game.

Another important aspect of Domain-Driven Design Cards is the goal of equally involving all group members, regardless of their level of knowledge and personality type. This also contributes to the goals of the Domain-Driven Design philosophy, which aims for a culture of broad mutual understanding and collaboration. Domain-Driven Design Cards are based on the assumption that rarely does a group consistently possess deep knowledge in the area of DDD. Therefore, the aim of Domain-Driven Design Cards is to ensure usability even without specialized expertise. Players are supported by the game cards, a DDD expert, and a moderator.

## Enabling through Gamification

The enabling process is undoubtedly multifaceted and complex. Enabling software architecture and Domain-Driven Design often involves knowledge building and high collaboration between different actors. Enabler Teams support this as method and subject matter experts. Moderation to support creative and collaborative activities as part of the enabling process is one of the main tasks of Enablers. Gamification enriches the method toolkit of an Enabler Team to support these activities in exciting, fun, and goal-oriented workshops.

### Enabling Domain-Driven Design through Domain-Driven Design Cards

Domain-Driven Design Cards are a playful approach to conveying and applying the principles and concepts of Domain-Driven Design. This is done through four standalone card games that collectively support the most important core elements of Domain-Driven Design throughout the software development process.

> Bounded Context Game
>
> Find and define Bounded Contexts based on the results of collaborative modeling techniques.

> Strategic Classification Game
>
> Evaluating the strategic importance and determining an action strategy for Subdomains or Bounded Contexts.

> Context Mapping Game
>
> Find and define dependencies between Bounded Contexts based on the Context Mapping method.

> Tactical Architecture Game
>
> Find a common architecture plan for implementing Bounded Contexts at the tactical architecture level.

All games provide space for communication, knowledge sharing, and moderated professional discussion. This promises good decisions considering all relevant perspectives and fosters a team vision and sense of togetherness.

## Collaborative Decision Making

#### Consensus and Consent Methods

Team decision-making can be supported by methods, such as Dot-Voting or Thumb-Voting. 
For Thumb-Voting, the games can be supplemented with [unFix Decision Patterns](https://unfix.com/decision-patterns). 
Dot-Voting is easy to conduct both on-site with a pen or adhesive dots and remotely on a collaboration board.
