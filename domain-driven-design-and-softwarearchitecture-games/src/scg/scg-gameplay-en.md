# The Strategic Classification Game

## Objective of the Game

The Strategic Classification Game aims to determine the strategic classification of a subdomain or bounded context and to derive the appropriate action strategy based on this classification.

### The Mission

Determine the strategic classification and action strategy using the evaluation and action strategy schema. The game ends once this has been done for all subdomains or bounded contexts of a business domain.

## Game Preparation

The prerequisite for playing the Strategic Classification Game is the familiarity with the bounded contexts. Each bounded context is described using the Bounded Context Canvas. The completed Bounded Context Canvases are used as the playing field, either physically or digitally. If subdomains are known, it is recommended to group bounded contexts of the same subdomain on the playing field.

## Game Progress

> 1. Evaluate Subdomain (Bounded Contexts) (60 minutes)

The game begins with the selection of the first evaluation object (subdomain or bounded context). This corresponds to the selection of the first mission. For this evaluation object, the presented evaluation schema is filled out.

In the first 15 minutes, players have the opportunity to think independently or to exchange ideas bilaterally with other players. The cards of the Strategic Classification Game provide assistance and explain the evaluation criteria and their classification.

After this introductory phase, the group discussion begins, during which any player can share their evaluation for the first evaluation criterion. The card that explains the evaluation is placed on the playing field. Other players join the discussion and also place their cards on the playing field. The team discussion leads to a decision regarding the classification as low, medium, or high.

This process is repeated for each evaluation criterion.

> 2. Decide on Strategic Classification (15 to 30 minutes)

Based on the evaluation of the individual criteria, the next step is to derive the strategic classification using the evaluation schema and to document it in the [Core Domain Chart](https://github.com/ddd-crew/core-domain-charts).

> 3. Determine Action Strategy (15 to 30 minutes)

In the next step, the players analyze the action strategy that corresponds to the strategic classification. This consists of implementation options and responsibility patterns. Here, too, players should have the opportunity to analyze this independently or to seek exchange with other players.

After this introductory phase of 10 to 15 minutes, any player again places their card for the implementation option and the responsibility pattern on the playing field and explains their perspective. Other players follow, and the group discussion ensues. Finally, a clear decision must be made within the group. This is documented by marking it in the action strategy schema.
