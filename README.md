## Enable Domain-Driven Design with Gamification

Domain-Driven Design Cards offer valuable methodological support for a range of strategic and 
tactical Domain-Driven Design workshops, and they're available for free. This initiative is a collaborative 
project with [nilsbert](https://github.com/nilsbert). For more information about us, you can explore the [website](www.architecture-enablers.de).

With Domain-Driven Design Cards, you can engage in activities such as the Context Mapping Game, 
the Strategic Classification Game, the Bounded Context Game, and the Architecture Game. If you're looking for a comprehensive guide 
on how to use them, please consult the following sections.
