## Enable Domain-Driven Design with Gamification

Domain-Driven Design Cards offer valuable methodological support for a range of strategic and 
tactical Domain-Driven Design workshops, and they're available for free. This initiative is a collaborative 
project with [nilsbert](https://github.com/nilsbert). For additional details on Domain-Driven Design and Domain-Driven Design Cards, 
you can explore my [website](www.architecture-enablers.de).

With Domain-Driven Design Cards, you can engage in activities such as the Context Mapping Game, 
the Bounded Context Game, and the Architecture Game. If you're looking for a comprehensive guide
